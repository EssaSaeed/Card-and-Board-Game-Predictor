Steps to run this desktop application:
1. Ensure you have an IDE for Java (like Netbeans, Eclipse etc.)
2. Download all the content
3. Extract all pertinent files (everything that needs to be extracted pretty much - or you can try making a new project and using my code)
4. Run the GuessingGameApp.java as it is the main file
5. Don't plagarize, have fun :)
